# lua-resume
QnD PDF resume generator in lua

This is juste some QnD (mostly dirty) code that i use to generate my resume, because i was too lazy to learn latex, and that was faster to do for me...
If you want to use it... well, first, learn latex or use a proper tool, you don't want to use this one.
If you *really* want to use it, you'll need luahpdf and lua5.2, then lua ./generate.lua, you'll get a resume.pdf file...
You'll also need to modify data.lua and create data-en.lua or data-fr.lua depending of which language you want

# Warning
Shitty code ahead!
